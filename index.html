    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // // our console shows 100 and 100
    // // but now
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // // our console now shows 200 and 11

    // let name = 'Wes';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // // console shows Wes Wes
    // name = 'wesley';
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // console shows wesley Wes

    // the values of strings, numbers and booleans go into it - if you change the original, it won't update the second

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    // team is just a reference to the original array
    // if you update an array, it will always reference back to the original

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // returns entire array
    // if you pass slice nothing, it will take a copy of the array and you can manipulate it there

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'hee haw';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // spread into that array
    // take items out of iterable and plop it into a new array

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    // we made a reference to the original, not a copy - can't do this.

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 });
    console.log(cap2);
    // captain will be updated
    // fold in all properties and values
    // fold in our own ones

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    // can spread into an object

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
        name: 'Wes',
        age: 100,
        social: {
            twitter: '@wesbos',
            facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
        }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // only does one level deep
    // would have to use clone deep
